### Who am I?
  - I'm Renee (they/them).
  - I work in fintech, at a startup called Cobalt Software, targeting the
    private equity industry. It's challenging and fun.
  - I went to Chalmers, in Gothenburg.
  - I write code in Python (among other languages) at work.
  - I'm passionate about transparency and pragmatism,
  - But programming is primarily an art, craft, and creative pursuit to me.

### If you liked what you saw today
  - I've heard good things about the book "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python"
  - Join the PP Slack, especially the Python channel.
  - Bookmark the official documentation
  - Go to pypi.org and look at other packages to get inspired to build stuff with

### If you didn't like what you saw today
  - It might just be my presentation of Python you didn't like
  - Python is a very _dynamic_ language -- we can do pretty much anything we
    want, and the interpreter won't complain until we try to do something
    impossible. If this ruins Python for you, but you envy how expressive it
    is, take a look at Typescript or OCaml.
  - If you like Python's dynamic nature and simplicity, but don't like its
    rigid top-to-bottom (imperative) model of execution, take a look at Clojure
    or Scheme/Racket.
